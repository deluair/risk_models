# Financial Risk Analysis System

A comprehensive framework for analyzing and monitoring financial risks, focusing on traditional financial risks, emerging threats, and structural shifts affecting the global financial sector.

## Overview

This system integrates advanced analytical techniques to identify, measure, visualize, and predict potential vulnerabilities within interconnected financial networks. It covers:

- **Traditional Risks**: Market, credit, liquidity, and operational risks
- **Emerging Threats**: Climate, cyber, and AI risks
- **Structural Shifts**: Digitalization impacts, non-bank financial intermediation, and global financial architecture evolution

## Features

- **Network Analysis**: Map complex interconnections between financial institutions, markets, and the real economy
- **Systemic Risk Metrics**: Implement market-based and network-based metrics for risk assessment
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning models for early warning systems and anomaly detection
- **Scenario Analysis**: Design and test severe but plausible scenarios across multiple risk dimensions
- **Cross-Border Risk**: Monitor capital flows, institutional linkages, and regulatory fragmentation
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize risk metrics and analysis results in real-time

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-risk-system.git
cd financial-risk-system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the System

```bash
# Run the main application
python -m src.main
```

### Dashboard

The system includes an interactive dashboard for visualizing risk metrics:

```bash
# Run the dashboard only
python -m src.visualization.dashboard
```

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8050` in your web browser.

## Risk Categories

The system analyzes the following risk categories:

### Traditional Risks
- **Market Risk**: Volatility, VaR, expected shortfall, correlation analysis
- **Credit Risk**: Default probabilities, loss given default, credit ratings migration
- **Liquidity Risk**: Liquidity coverage ratio, bid-ask spreads, funding concentration
- **Operational Risk**: Loss events, recovery time, control effectiveness

### Emerging Threats
- **Climate Risk**: Physical risks, transition risks, carbon intensity
- **Cyber Risk**: Attack frequency, vulnerabilities, data breach impacts
- **AI Risk**: Model risks, algorithmic bias, AI governance

### Structural Shifts
- **Digitalization**: Digital infrastructure, technological concentration
- **Non-bank Intermediation**: Growth rates, interconnectedness, leverage
- **Global Architecture**: Financial fragmentation, regulatory divergence

## Network Analysis

The system employs network theory to analyze:

- **Interconnections**: Map relationships between financial institutions
- **Contagion Channels**: Identify potential default cascades
- **Systemic Importance**: Calculate centrality measures to identify critical nodes
- **Community Detection**: Find clusters of closely connected financial entities

## Extending the System

To add new risk modules:

1. Create a new module in `src/risk_modules/`
2. Add risk metrics to the `RiskRegistry` in `src/risk_modules/risk_registry.py`
3. Implement analysis functions in `src/analytics/analysis_engine.py`
4. Add visualization components to the dashboard in `src/visualization/dashboard.py`

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`
